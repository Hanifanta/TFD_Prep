# Study Resources for TensorFlow Developer Preparation Certification
## Coursera Course
One of the most beneficial resources for preparing for the TensorFlow Developer Certification is the [DeepLearning.ai TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/tensorflow-in-practice) available on Coursera. This specialization comprises four courses:

- [Introduction to TensorFlow](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-tensorflow/home/welcome)
- [Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks-tensorflow/home/welcome)
- [Natural Language Processing (NLP)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/natural-language-processing-tensorflow)
- [Sequences, Time Series, and Prediction](https://www.coursera.org/learn/tensorflow-sequences-time-series-and-prediction/home/welcome)

These courses focus on instructing learners on how to effectively utilize TensorFlow 2.x while also providing an understanding of the fundamental concepts involved. If you are new to deep learning, it is recommended to first complete Dr. Andrew Ng's [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) to gain a strong foundation in the mathematical principles and detailed workings of deep learning. For individuals who are unfamiliar with TensorFlow, it is advisable to explore the tutorials provided on the [tensorflow.org](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials) platform before delving into the specialization.

The estimated completion time for the entire specialization is 16 weeks, with each course spanning four weeks. Each weekly module typically consists of concise video lessons and quizzes, requiring less than 30 minutes to complete. The programming exercises may range from 30 minutes to a few hours, depending on your familiarity with the topics. It is important to note that the programming assignments are evaluated based on specific network architecture requirements, so carefully following the guidance provided in the reference notebooks and lecture materials is essential. While it is hypothetically possible to complete the courses in six weeks with focused effort, beginners may need more than 16 weeks to fully grasp the specialization's content.

## TensorFlow Developer Certificate Website
The [TensorFlow Developer Certificate](https://www.tensorflow.org/certificate) website offers two invaluable resources:

- [The Candidate Handbook](https://www.tensorflow.org/site-assets/downloads/marketing/cert/TF_Certificate_Candidate_Handbook.pdf): This document includes a skill checklist and provides logistical information on exam registration. It offers an overview of the exam structure and the skills assessed.
- [Environment Setup Guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/extras/cert/Setting_Up_TF_Developer_Certificate_Exam.pdf): This guide provides detailed instructions on configuring your environment for the certification exam. It covers setting up a virtual environment for testing purposes.
These resources will facilitate your understanding of the certification exam requirements and logistics, ensuring that you are well-prepared for the practical assessment.

By utilizing these study resources, you can enhance your knowledge of TensorFlow, gain hands-on experience, and increase your chances of successfully obtaining the TensorFlow Developer Certification. Good luck with your preparation!
